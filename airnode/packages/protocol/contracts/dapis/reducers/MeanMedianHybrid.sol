/// Mean-median hybrid uses mean under normal circumstances for accuracy, but
/// falls back to median if there is a large enough discrepancy between mean
/// and median. Since the calculation of mean and its validation takes O(n)
/// time, it is more scalable than bare median under normal circumstances
/// (where mean will be similar to median).
/// @dev Even though the types are defined as `int256` for consistency, this
/// method is more suitable for similarly values. For example, consider the
/// values [-100, -4, 1, 1, 1, 1, 100]. The mean of these values is 0 and the
/// median is 1. Here, even though the mean is very close to the median, upper
/// and lower tolerances will be zero, which means the reduction will fall
/// back to median. Therefore, consider using Median.sol instead for values
/// with potentially alternating signs.
/// Note that there is a potential for overflow while summing large enough
/// values (in `Mean.aggregateInplace`). If that is a probability, use
/// Median.sol instead.
